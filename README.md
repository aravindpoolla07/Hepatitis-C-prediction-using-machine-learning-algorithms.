# Hepatitis-C-prediction-using-machine-learning-algorithms.
This is a project to predict Hepatitis C using machine learning algorithms like Decision tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Gaussian Naive Bayes and ADA Boost. Out of all the algorithms used Multi-Layer Perceptron has performed well when considering accuracy and f-measure.
